# 👋 Hi, I’m @SauravKumar

- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development, with a strong focus on the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and **Java Web Development**.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Full Stack techniques, improving my proficiency in building scalable web apps using both **Java** and the **MERN stack**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, MERN stack development, or Java-based web applications.
